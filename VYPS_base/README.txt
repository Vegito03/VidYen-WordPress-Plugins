 Designer thoughts:
 
 There are already many systems that if Frakensteined together will kind of do what I envisioned.
 Yet it suprises me no one has made a gamification system for monetization (they have for engagment).
 To be fair earn.gg does this, but he's not intended it to be shared with other admins.
 However, I want Coin Hive (or a better altenrative) to become the future of micro-monetization.
 The idea behind the VidYen Point system is to allow WordPress admins to track points from
 their users and let them earn some type of awards. I was thinking Gift Cards through WooCommerce as
 we already tested this and was popular but one could in theory use anything that you can stuff into
 WooCommerce as a reward (images, songs, moviews, even plugins themselves. The goals is to shift
 the world away from simply trying to make people watch ads (which is dying with the popularity of the
 Brave Browser so if you intend to make a living through simply getting people to read your blog or video
 and then click on an add for some odd reason, your going to be disapointed).
 
 So... The idea is to get people to watch gamified ads or prefereable mine Coin Hive to monetize your site and you
 (the site admin) give them a good reason to turn their ad blocker off. How you reward them is up to you,
 but the VidYen point system is trying to help you track users when they do watch ads and give you a way
 to reward that activity.
 
 Good luck and godspeed!
