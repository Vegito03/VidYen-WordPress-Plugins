# vyps-pro-adgate
Code for the pro version

## Commentary

You maybe wondering why I'm putting the pro version on GitHub... Well... Since VYPS is all open source, you can just comment a few lines and remove the logos yourself, but I suppose it would be helpful if you wanted to help out VidYen, LLC continue the progress towards making this easier for everyone.

## Fork of Blank Slate

Due to the nature of Adgate Postback I had to find a quick way to reduce as much information as possible for the Adgate return.

I have modifications to that and integrate with less of the WP script hooks. Their license remains the same. See the blankslateREADME.md for their credits.
