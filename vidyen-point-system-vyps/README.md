VidYen Point System [VYPS] allows you to gamify monetization by giving your users a reason to turn off adblockers in return for rewards and recognition.

This is a multipart system - similar to WooCommerce - which allows WordPress administrators to track points for rewards in monetization systems.

*NOTE:* Without the Adscend or Coinhive addon to VYPS, you can only assign points manually to users. Visit [VidYen](https://vidyen.com/vyps/) for details.
