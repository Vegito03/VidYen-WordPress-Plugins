# VYPS Uninstall plugin

Due to realizing that a user that does not read instructors will have catastrophic dataloss, I termporarily made a plug in for myself and commented out the table drops for the base plugin. This will be updated in the future and I will need to go back and make all the README.md files presentable, etc etc.

Installing and uninstalling this plugin will drop the tables vyps_points and vyps_points_log
