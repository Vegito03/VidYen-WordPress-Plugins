# VYPS

Note
------------
Each of the folder above is to be zipped before uploading to WordPress. They all work together so it was easier to put them in one repository than make one for every single plugin. For end users just download master and extract folders and then zip them back up for upload, but this is for devs and not for the WordPress.org releases.

If you have no clue about what these are about, these are WordPress plugins that allow site admins to create points system to track AdScend and CoinHive monetization and translate those points into WooCommerce credit or other game systems.

We do have our own built in VY256 Miner which generally avoids adblockers as JS files hosted locally.

Goals are to eventually have APIs that tie into actual webgames
Say Poker or even web based combat games.

Originally, VidYen was a YouTube alternative with a different ranking and
monetization system, but it was soon discovered that the same system could
be used for just about anything (Web Comics, Message boards, news feeds etc)
you can put onto WordPress so it was decided (mainly Felty) to create a system
that could be used for that.

Current Plugins
--------

I need to finish labeling what the folders more professionally but here is what I have:

vidyen-point-system-vyps = The folder on WordPress.org release

VYPS_un = Uninstall plugin

Extras
--------
There is a VYPS combat came in another repo if you want to test.
